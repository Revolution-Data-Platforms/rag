       "[Document(page_content='Chapter1. TL1 Overview\\n\\n1.1 What is TL1\\n\\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a set of ASCII (156American Standard Code for Information Interchange)-based instructions, or messages, that an operations support system (OSS) uses to manage a network element (NE) and its resources. TL1 provides a standard set of messages that can be used for communication between operating systems and NEs, and personnel and NEs.\\n\\n1.2. What are TL1 Message Types and Example\\n\\nThere are two main types of standard-defined TL1 messages: command/responses and autonomous messages.\\n\\n1. Command/Responses—These are initiated by a user and provide two parts: a request to the NE to set or get information, and a response from the NE containing completion or status codes and requested information. Request, or input messages are used to issue the request portions of command messages to the NE. Command messages are often referred to as command/response messages, where the request portion is an input message (OSS to NE) and the response portion is an output message (NE to OSS). Command/Responses can be further classified as follows:\\n\\na) Set information—The simplest type of messages are those that set information or instruct the NE to perform an action and\\n\\nreturn only a result with no data in the response.\\n\\nExample: ENT-CRS-<ODU_TYPE> to create ODU cross-connection\\n\\nb) Get information—Some TL1 commands get information or request information to be returned from the NE.\\n\\nExample: RTRV-ALM-ALL to show the current status of all active alarm conditions\\n\\nc) Response message—The response portion of a command message correlates to a particular request message. If a command\\n\\nis successful, the NE sends a response message containing the COMPLD code. Example:\\n\\nSV192-DATA-461 2003-08-05 10:35:17\\n\\nM 123 COMPLD\\n\\n;\\n\\nIf a command fails, the NE sends an error response which includes the DENY code and may or may not contain an error\\n\\nmessage.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nsv192-DATA-461 2003-08-05 10:35:17\\n\\nM 123 DENY;\\n\\nThe following list shows standard responses:\\n\\nCOMPLD—Completed\\n\\nDENY—TL1 command failed\\n\\nPRTL— Partially successful response. The requested action can be completed for some of the specified AIDs but not\\n\\n11-8\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\nfor all of them.\\n\\nRTRV— The response is successful but is lengthy and is being returned in multiple parts. Each part has a RTRV response code, but the final response has a COMPLD response code.\\n\\nd) Response acknowledgment—Responses may also include intermediate acknowledgment messages. Brief messages that update the user about the status of a given commands, are called acknowledgments. When a command has been sent to the NE and the NE takes longer than two seconds to respond, the NE sends an acknowledgment message that needs to be followed later by the full response.\\n\\n2. Autonomous events— These messages are used to report alarms, configuration changes or condition changes. Many of these messages, such as those are related to alarm conditions, are spontaneously triggered by the NE itself without intervention. Other messages, such as those are related to the reporting of periodic condition states or performance data values, are scheduled by the NE user through other commands. Autonomous messages are not issued to the NE and hence they do not include input formats or input examples. Example: REPT ALM\\n\\n1.3. Connect to TL1\\n\\nThe first step in using TL1 is to connect to TL1 session. You only have to connect to TL1 one time per session. A session is a related set of communication transactions between two or more network devices. There are three ways to connect to TL1: via CTC, telnet, and craft interface. Perform one of the following procedures to connect to TL1.\\n\\n1.3.1 Launch CTC and Open a TL1 Session From the PC connected to the start Internet Explorer. Step 2 Enter the IP address of the node you want to communicate with in the browser’s web address (URL)\\n\\nStep 1\\n\\nfield.', metadata={'source': 'data/test.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Step 1\\n\\nfield.\\n\\nLog into the CTC. The IP address at the title bar should match the IP address of the node you entered in Step 2.\\n\\nStep 3\\n\\nOnce logged into the CTC, there are two ways to open a TL1 session: • Click Tools > Open TL1 Connection, or • Click on the Open TL1 Connection button on the toolbar. From the Select Node dialog box choose the node to communicate. Click OK.\\n\\nStep 4\\n\\nStep 5 Step 6\\n\\nA TL1 interface window opens. There are three sub-windows in the TL1 interface window: Request History, Message Log/Summary Log, and TL1 request. Type commands in the TL1 request window. You will see responses in the Message log window. The Request History window allows you to recall previous commands by double-clicking on them.\\n\\nVerify that the Connect button is selected (grayed out). You are ready to log into TL1\\n\\nStep 7 Step 8\\n\\n11-9\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\n1.3.2 Telnet to Open a TL1 Session\\n\\nTo communicate with the NCS network element (NE) using TL1 commands through a Telnet session over a craft interface or a LAN connection, you can choose either of the following two ports:\\n\\nPort number 3083 is a Telnet port that uses the Telnet protocol and associated Telnet escape sequences.\\n\\nPort number 2361 is supported for backward compatibility with earlier releases and has the same behavior as Port 3083\\n\\n(Telnet port). Use the following procedure with PCs running Windows operating systems.\\n\\nNote: Port number 3082 is a raw TCP/IP port; it is not an interactive port and is not recommended for use as an alternate telnet port.\\n\\nAt the Unix command prompt, Type: TELNET <NODE IP ADDRESS OR NODE NAME> <PORT NUMBER> and press Enter.\\n\\nStep 1\\n\\nThe Node IP address or Node Name refers to the IP address or Node Name of the node you want to communicate with. Port number is the port (2361 or 3083) where TL1 commands are understood. If the connection is successful, a screen opens with a prompt.\\n\\nYou are ready to log into TL1.\\n\\nStep 2\\n\\n1.3.3 Use a Craft Interface to Open a TL1 Session\\n\\nThe craft interface on ECU is used accessing the Cisco NCS 4000 Series. With one RJ-45 LAN connection you can access the system using a standard browser interface. In the browser interface, you can perform local and remote Operations, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning (OAM&P) functions and open a VT100 emulation window to enter TL1 commands. If a browser is not available, you can access the system using a nine -pin EIA/TIA-232 port. The EIA/TIA-232 port supports VT100 emulation which allows TL1 commands to be entered directly without a browser.\\n\\nConnect to the craft interface of the ECU unit. Configure the terminal emulation software (Hyperterminal):\\n\\nStep 1 Step 2\\n\\na) Terminal emulation = vt100\\n\\nb) Bits per second = 9600\\n\\nc) Parity = None\\n\\nd) Stop BITS = 1\\n\\nFlow control = None Press Enter. An angle bracket prompt (>) appears. You are ready to log into TL1.\\n\\nStep 3 Step 4\\n\\n1.3.4 Log Into TL1\\n\\nOnce you have connected to TL1, now you can log into TL1 in order to issue commands. Login into TL1 is to be done once per session.\\n\\nIssue the ACT-USER command: Input Format:\\n\\nStep 1\\n\\nACT-USER:[<TID>]:<UID>:<CTAG>[::<PID>];\\n\\nTID is the name of the node you want to access. If you only want to query the node you connected to, leave the TID\\n\\nblank.\\n\\n11-10\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\nUID is your user ID. UID can be up to 10 characters.\\n\\nCTAG is any non-blank character series that does not have to be unique.\\n\\nPID is your password. PID can be up to 10 characters. PIDs are encrypted and are displayed as asterisks (*).\\n\\nInput Example:\\n\\nACT-USER:PETALUMA:DXT:100::MYPASSWD;\\n\\nConfirm you receive a COMPLD response to indicate the command was completed successfully.\\n\\nStep 2\\n\\nResponse Example:\\n\\nTID-000 1998-06-20 14:30:00\\n\\nM 001 COMPLD\\n\\nDXT:2003-01-02 14-04-49,0;\\n\\n1.4.

Command Action and Categories\\n\\nWhen you have connected and logged into a TL1 session, you are ready to begin issuing TL1 commands and autonomous messages. TL1 commands and autonomous messages can be used to accomplish a variety of actions. Determining the correct command or autonomous message you need begins with identifying what action you want to perform. The first part of every command and autonomous message helps identify the action that command or autonomous message performs.\\n\\nTable 1-1 TL1 Command and Autonomous message Action\\n\\nCommand or Autonomous Mes- sage That Begin With ACT ALW CANC (autonomous message) CANC DLT ED ENT INH INIT REPT (autonomous message) RLS RMV RST RTRV SCHED SET\\n\\nGenerally Do This Activate Allow Report Cancel Delete Edit/Change Enter/Create Inhibit Initialize Report Release Remove Restore Retrieve Schedule Set\\n\\nExample ACT-USER ALW-MSG-ALL CANC (reports a cancelled session) CANC-USER DLT-TADRMAP ED-NE-GEN ENT-CRS INH-MSG-ALL INIT-SYS REPT EVT-<MOD2> RLS-PROTNSW-<MOD2> RMV-<MOD2> RST-<MOD2> RTRV-TRC-<MOD2> SCHED-PMREPT-<MOD2> SET-ATTR-SECUDFLT\\n\\n11-11\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\nThe following table shows some examples of actions, categories, and commands that apply to the Cisco NCS 4000 series.\\n\\nTable 1-2 Some TL1 Category Examples\\n\\nLook In This Cate- gory Equipment System Synchronization Cross Connections\\n\\nApplicable Command or Autonomous Message ED-EQPT SET-TOD REPT ALM ODU DLT-CRS-<PATH>\\n\\nIf You Want To Regen Configuration Change the time/date on the NE See the alarms on an ODU Delete a cross-connection on an ODU path Perform Linear Protection Switch on ODU Path Release Linear Protection Switch on ODU Path\\n\\nProtection\\n\\nOPR-PROTNSW-<PATH>\\n\\nProtection\\n\\nRLS-PROTNSW-<PATH>\\n\\n1.5.

TL1 Commands Overview\\n\\n1.6.1 TL1 Command Syntax\\n\\nTL1 commands conform to the following syntax:\\n\\na:b:c:d:e: ... z;\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\n“a” is the command code.\\n\\n“b” is the target identifier (TID).\\n\\n“c” is the access identifier (AID) or the user identifier (UID).\\n\\n“d” is the correlation tag (CTAG).\\n\\n11-12\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\n“e: ... z;” are other positions required for various commands.\\n\\nThe TID, AID, and CTAG route and control the TL1 command. Other parameters provide additional information required to complete the action requested by the command. TL1 command codes, parameter names, and parameter values are not case sensitive, unless specifically noted in the command description.', metadata={'source': 'data/test.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The TID is a unique name given to each system when it is installed. The name identifies the particular NE, to which each command is directed. The value of TID can be any TL1 identifier or text string, but it is limited to 20 characters. An identifier contains any number of letters or digits, but must start with a letter. A text string is any alphanumeric or punctuation characters enclosed in double quotes. The presence of the TID is required in all input commands, but its value can be null (represented by two successive colons). The TID can be null when the operating system directly communicates with the target NE. The recommended value for the TID, when it is used, is the target’s common language location identifier (CLLI) code. To establish the TID for a node, use the Provisioning > General tab in Cisco Transport Controller (CTC).\\n\\nThe AID is an access code used to identify and address specific objects within the NE. These objects include individual pieces of equipment, transport spans, access tributaries, and other objects.\\n\\nThe CTAG is a unique identifier given to each input command by the user. When the NE responds to a specific command, it includes the command’s CTAG in the reply. Including the CTAG eliminates discrepancies about which response corresponds to which command. Valid CTAG values include strings of up to six characters composed of identifiers (alphanumeric, beginning with a letter) or decimal numerals (a string of decimal digits with an optional non trailing period).\\n\\nThe following specification characters are used throughout this document as vehicles for defining the syntax: Angle brackets (< >) enclose a symbol specifier, for example <CTAG>. Square brackets ([ ]) enclose an optional symbol, for example [<TID>]. Quotation marks (“ ”) enclose a literal character, as shown in the following output example:\\n\\n\"FAC-5-3-1-1,OTU1:MN,HI-RXPOWER,NSA,08-18,12-56-40,NEND,RCV:\\\\\"Facility High Rx power\\\\\",\"\\n\\n1.6.2 Parameter Types\\n\\nThis section provides a description of all message parameter types defined for the TL1 messages used in the Cisco NCS 4000 series. Individual parameters are listed within each command description.\\n\\n1.6.2.1 ATAG Description\\n\\nThe autonomous message tag (ATAG) is used for message sequencing. There are four streams of autonomous messages and each stream corresponds to a sequence. The sequence numbers increment by one for each autonomous message within that stream. The format and range of ATAG differs for each stream. The four streams are:\\n\\n1. Alarmed events: These include REPT ALM and REPT EVT (except REPT EVT SESSION) messages as\\n\\nwell as the REPT SW autonomous message. The ATAG format is x.y, where:\\n\\n-\\n\\nx is the sequence number of this alarmed event. This is an integer in the range of 0 to 9999. y is the sequence number of the previous alarmed event that is related to this alarmed event. This is an integer in the range of 0 to 9999.\\n\\nIf there is no such previous related event, then y will be the same as x. For example, the first t ime an alarm is raised, you will receive the autonomous message:\\n\\n11-13\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\nnode1 1970-12-22 20:04:53 * 0066.0066 REPT ALM Optics \"FAC-0-8-0-2:MN,IMPROPRMVL,NSA,12-22,20-04-51,NEND,:\\\\\"Improper Removal\\\\\",Optics\" ;\\n\\nWhen this alarmed event/condition is cleared, you will receive the autonomous message:\\n\\nnode1 1970-12-22 20:05:11 A 0068.0066 REPT ALM Optics \"FAC-0-8-0-2:CL,IMPROPRMVL,NSA,12-22,20-04-51,NEND,:\\\\\"Improper Removal\\\\\",Optics\" ;\\n\\n2. Database change messages: The REPT DBCHG message falls into this category.\\n\\nThe ATAG format is x, where x is the sequence number of the database change update message. This is an integer in the range of 0 to 9999. For example:\\n\\nnode1 1970-12-22 18:19:03 A 43 REPT DBCHG\\n\\n\"TIME=18-19-2,DATE=1970-12-22,SOURCE=1,USERID=root,DBCHGSEQ=14:ENT-ODU0:ODU-0-\\n\\n8-0-10-20:::\" ;', metadata={'source': 'data/test.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='node1 1970-12-22 18:19:03 A 43 REPT DBCHG\\n\\n\"TIME=18-19-2,DATE=1970-12-22,SOURCE=1,USERID=root,DBCHGSEQ=14:ENT-ODU0:ODU-0-\\n\\n8-0-10-20:::\" ;\\n\\n3. PM reports: The REPT PM messages fall into this category. The ATAG format is x, where x is the sequence number of the PM report. This is an integer in the range of 0 to 9999.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n10.78.161.183 1970-12-03 22:16:26\\n\\nA 54 REPT PM ODU2\\n\\n\"ODU-0-7-0-7,ODU2:UAS-PM,87,COMPLD,NEND,,15-MIN,12-3,22-16\"\\n\\n;\\n\\nThis sequence number is global across all existing PM schedules.\\n\\n4. Autonomous messages specific to a TL1 session: These messages are usually related to the security aspect of the TL1 session. Only the autonomous messages REPT EVT SESSION and CANC fall under this category. This is an integer in the range 0 to 9999. For example: node1 1970-12-22 18:30:31 A 1 CANC \"root\" ;\\n\\n1.6.2.2 CTAG Description\\n\\nThe CTAG is included in each command by the user and is repeated by the NE in the response to allow the user to associate the command and response messages. The valid values for a CTAG are strings of up to 6 characters composed of identifiers (alphanumeric, beginning with a letter) or nonzero decimal numbers (a string of decimal digits with an optional nontrailing period).\\n\\nA zero in the response field is valid when indicating an error; for example, issuing a semicolon by itself results in:\\n\\n> ;\\n\\nNo Input For Parsing.\\n\\n11-14\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\n>\\n\\n1.6.2.3 TID Description\\n\\nThe TID is the name of the NE where the command is addressed. TID is the Telcordia name for the system.\\n\\n1.6.2.4 Parameter Notes\\n\\nThe following list contains general notes that apply to parameters:\\n\\nIf a parameter is set to a value that is inconsistent with something already in the database and that value is not changed to a consistent value, then the command is denied. If a parameter is set to a value that is consistent with what is already in the database, but another parameter in the same command is incompatible, then the command is denied. - The correct way to issue a command where parameters might be in conflict is to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\uf0a7 \\uf0a7\\n\\nIssue that command and change all relevant parameters to compatible values. Issue the command again to change the target values.\\n\\nThe default values for command attributes can be seen using the RTRV commands, provided they are not\\n\\naltered by a provisioning command.\\n\\nThe default for an optional field of an ED command is either the provisioned default value or the last\\n\\nprovisioned value in the previous ED command.\\n\\n1.7 Autonomous Message Syntax\\n\\nAutonomous messages are used to report alarms, configuration changes, and condition changes. Many of these messages, such as those relating to alarm conditions, are spontaneously triggered by the NE itself without intervention. Other messages, such as those relating to the reporting of periodic condition states or performance data values, are scheduled by the NE user through other commands. Because you do not issue autonomous messages to the NE, they do not include input formats or input examples.\\n\\nThe following figure shows the autonomous message format. The autonomous message tag (ATAG) is used for message sequencing. The number is incremented by one for each autonomous message sent by the NE. Cisco NEs use whole numbers 0000 to 9999.\\n\\nNote: Some autonomous messages (REPT DBCHG and REPT EVT SESSION, for example) differ slightly from the format shown in the third line of the following figure.\\n\\nFigure 1-1 Autonomous Message Format\\n\\n11-15\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\nThe alarm code indicates the severity of the autonomous message. Valid values for alarm codes in decreasing order of severity are as follows:\\n\\n*C—Critical alarm • **—Major alarm */\\\\—Minor alarm • • A/\\\\ —Nonalarmed message', metadata={'source': 'data/test.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='*C—Critical alarm • **—Major alarm */\\\\—Minor alarm • • A/\\\\ —Nonalarmed message\\n\\nCritical, Major, and Minor correspond to the reporting of alarmed events. The Non-alarmed message designation is used when the NE is reporting non-alarmed events, periodic measurements, or results of previously scheduled diagnostics or audits. If multiple alarms are reported in the same message, the alarm code represents the highest severity of those being reported.\\n\\nThe following is an example of an output message that includes the Critical alarm code:\\n\\nCISCO1 1971-07-06 06:04:31\\n\\nC 0244.0244 REPT ALM EQPT\\n\\n\"LC-0-3:CR,LINE CARD IMPROPER REMOVAL NOTIFICATION,SA,07-06,06-04-31,,:\\\\\"LINE CARD IMPROPER REMOVAL\\\\\",EQPT\"\\n\\n;\\n\\n1.8 Command Completion Behavior\\n\\nWhen you enter a TL1 command, one of three completion codes will be returned. The completion codes are: completed (COMPLD), partial (PRTL), and deny (DENY). You can specify an explicit, implicit, or explicit with implicit list as explained in the following sections.\\n\\n11-16\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\n1.8.1 General Rules\\n\\n1.8.1.1 Explicit List of AIDs-No Wildcards\\n\\nIf a set of AIDs is explicitly listed, including a set of just one AID, then each AID must complete successfully to return a COMPLD message. If more than one AID is in the set and at least one AID succeeds but all do not, then a PRTL with errors for each failed AID is returned. If all AIDs in the set fail, a DENY with errors for each failed AID is returned.\\n\\n1.8.1.2 Implicit List of AIDs-Single AID with Wildcard\\n\\nIf a set of AIDs is implied by the use of the ALL modifier on a single AID, then follow the same rules as in the Section Explicit List of AIDs—No Wildcards. The caveat is that the implicit list only includes AIDs that apply to the command. For example, assume SLOT-3 contains an NCS4K-24LR-O-S card and only VC-0-1-0-4 and VC-0-1-0-7 are of path-width VC464c.\\n\\nApply the following rules to the set:\\n\\nIf all valid AIDs match, COMPLD is returned with a matching list of cross-connections. If some valid AIDs match but not all, FAC-*-* is returned with a matching list of cross-connections. For other scenarios, PRTL is returned. If all valid AIDs fail to match, DENY is returned.\\n\\n1. 2.\\n\\n3.\\n\\n1.8.1.3 Explicit List Grouped with Implicit List\\n\\nIf the set of AIDs is composed of two subsets, one set including explicitly stated AIDs and the other set implied by one or more AID(s) with the ALL modifier, then follow the rules in the “Explicit List of AIDs—No Wildcards” and “Implicit List of AIDs—Single AID With Wildcard” sections respectively. Apply the logic in the following table to the results from the two subsets:\\n\\nTable 1-2 Explicit List, implicit List and Combined List logic\\n\\nExplicit List returns COMPLD COMPLD PRTL PRTL COMPLD DENY DENY PRTL DENY\\n\\nImplicit List returns Combined List returns COMPLD DENY COMPLD DENY PRTL PRTL COMPLD PRTL DENY\\n\\nCOMPLD plus matching list PRTL with errors plus matching list PRTL with errors plus matching list PRTL with errors plus matching list PRTL with errors plus matching list PRTL with errors plus matching list PRTL with errors plus matching list PRTL with errors plus matching list DENY with errors\\n\\n11-17\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\n1.8.2 Command Completion Behavior For Retrieval of Cross\\n\\nConnections\\n\\nWhen you enter a RTRV-CRS command, one of three completion codes will be returned. The completion codes are: COMPLD, PRTL, and DENY. You can specify an explicit, implicit, or explicit with implicit list as explained in the following sections.\\n\\n1.8.2.1 Explicit List of AIDs-No Wildcards\\n\\nFor an explicit list of AID on a RTRV-CRS command, an error code will be returned for each AID that fails validation (for example, the user specifies ODU-0-0-0-ALL when SLOT 0 only contains an ODU 1) or for each AID where no matching cross-connection is found. To determine the completion code, follow the rules from the Explicit list of AIDs-No Wildcards', metadata={'source': 'data/test.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='If the result is either PRTL or COMPLD, then a list of matching cross -connections will accompany the response.\\n\\n1.8.2.2 Implicit List of AIDs-Single AID With Wildcard\\n\\nIf a set of AIDs is implied by the use of the all modifiers on a single AID, then follow the same AID expansion rule as defined in the example from the implicit list of AIDs-Single AID With Wildcard.\\n\\nApply the following rules to the set:\\n\\n• •\\n\\nIf all valid AIDs match, COMPLD is returned with a matching list of cross-connections. If some valid AIDs match but not all, COMPLD is returned with a matching list of cross-connections. If all valid AIDs fail to match, DENY is returned.\\n\\nFor example, consider the command RTRV-CRS-ODU0:[<TID>]: ODU-0-0-0-0,ODG-1:<CTAG>;\\n\\nIn this example, the set is traversed and returns only the ODU cross-connections that exist using endpoints in that set. If no cross-connections are retrieved, COMPLD is returned.\\n\\n1.8.2.3 Explicit List Grouped With Implicit List\\n\\nWhen you have determined the implicit list, apply the rules in the implicit List of AIDs-Single AID with Wildcard to the implicit list and the rules from the Explicit List of AIDs-no Wildcards to the explicit list.

A maximum of 20 commands are stored. All types of commands are stored, including invalid commands. If the session is a GNE session, it will store commands sent to both the gateway network element (GNE) and the end network element (ENE).\\n\\nPressing Ctrl-R recalls the last command issued. Each time Ctrl-R is pressed, a previously issued command is\\n\\ndisplayed.\\n\\nPressing Ctrl-F recalls commands in the forward direction.\\n\\nWhen a command has been recalled, you can use the Backspace key to edit the command as necessary. Cursor keys (for example, left and right arrows) are not permitted for editing.\\n\\nNote: Command recall keys are only available when using a serial port session or an interactive Telnet session (for example, telnet <hostname> 3083).\\n\\n11-18\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\n1.10 Default Values\\n\\n1.10.1 Performance\\n\\nPerformance Default Values lists the default performance values that are applied by the system when they are not explicitly specified during performance provisioning.\\n\\nTable 1-3 Performance Default Values\\n\\nCommands INHMODE\\n\\nParameter Default ALW\\n\\nTMPER\\n\\n15-min\\n\\nMONLEV\\n\\n1-UP\\n\\nREPTINVL\\n\\n15-min\\n\\n1.10.2 Protection\\n\\nProtection Default Values lists the default protection values that are applied by the system when they are not explicitly specified during protection provisioning.\\n\\nTable 1-4 Protection Default Values\\n\\nCommands RVRTV\\n\\nParameter Default N\\n\\nRVTM\\n\\n5\\n\\nRECRT\\n\\nN\\n\\nCONMODE\\n\\nSNC-N\\n\\n1.10.3 Ports\\n\\nPorts Default Values lists the default port values that are applied by the system when they are not explicitly specified during port provisioning.\\n\\nTable 1-5 Ports Default Values\\n\\nCommands\\n\\nParameter Default PJMON defaults to 0.\\n\\nSFBER defaults to 1E-4.\\n\\nSTM Line\\n\\nSDBER defaults to 1E-7.\\n\\nMODE defaults to SDH.\\n\\nPST defaults to IS,NR\\n\\n11-19\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\n1.10.4 VC Paths\\n\\nVC Paths Default Values lists the default VC path values that are applied by the system when they are not explicitly specified during VC path provisioning.\\n\\nTable 1-6 VC Paths Default Values\\n\\nVC Path\\n\\nParameter Default SFBER, SDBER\\n\\nSFBER defaults to 1E-4.\\n\\nSDBER defaults to 1E-6.\\n\\nEXPTRC defaults to a copy of the provisioned string or NULL when TRCMODE is OFF mode.\\n\\nVC Path\\n\\nEXPTRC defaults to the user entered string when the TRCMODE is MANUAL mode.\\n\\nEXPTRC defaults to a copy of the acquired received string or NULL if the string has not been acquired when the TRCMODE is AUTO mode.\\n\\n1.10.5 Equipment', metadata={'source': 'data/test.pdf'}),\n",

Command Action and Categories\\n\\nWhen you have connected and logged into a TL1 session, you are ready to begin issuing TL1 commands and autonomous messages. TL1 commands and autonomous messages can be used to accomplish a variety of actions. Determining the correct command or autonomous message you need begins with identifying what action you want to perform. The first part of every command and autonomous message helps identify the action that command or autonomous message performs.\\n\\nTable 1-1 TL1 Command and Autonomous message Action\\n\\nCommand or Autonomous Mes- sage That Begin With ACT ALW CANC (autonomous message) CANC DLT ED ENT INH INIT REPT (autonomous message) RLS RMV RST RTRV SCHED SET\\n\\nGenerally Do This Activate Allow Report Cancel Delete Edit/Change Enter/Create Inhibit Initialize Report Release Remove Restore Retrieve Schedule Set\\n\\nExample ACT-USER ALW-MSG-ALL CANC (reports a cancelled session) CANC-USER DLT-TADRMAP ED-NE-GEN ENT-CRS INH-MSG-ALL INIT-SYS REPT EVT-<MOD2> RLS-PROTNSW-<MOD2> RMV-<MOD2> RST-<MOD2> RTRV-TRC-<MOD2> SCHED-PMREPT-<MOD2> SET-ATTR-SECUDFLT\\n\\n11-11\\n\\nTL1 Command Guide for Cisco NCS 4000 Series, R 6.5.28\\n\\nThe following table shows some examples of actions, categories, and commands that apply to the Cisco NCS 4000 series.\\n\\nTable 1-2 Some TL1 Category Examples\\n\\nLook In This Cate- gory Equipment System Synchronization Cross Connections\\n\\nApplicable Command or Autonomous Message ED-EQPT SET-TOD REPT ALM ODU DLT-CRS-<PATH>\\n\\nIf You Want To Regen Configuration Change the time/date on the NE See the alarms on an ODU Delete a cross-connection on an ODU path Perform Linear Protection Switch on ODU Path Release Linear Protection Switch on ODU Path\\n\\nProtection\\n\\nOPR-PROTNSW-<PATH>\\n\\nProtection\\n\\nRLS-PROTNSW-<PATH>\\n\\n1.5. Basic Commands\\n\\nThis section lists the basic commands to help you get started. You must be connected and logged into aTL1 session. After you issue a command, confirm you receive a COMPLD response to indicate the command was completed successfully.\\n\\nNote: If you receive a DENY response, first check the syntax you entered for accuracy.\\n\\nTo retrieve configuration information about an E1 port, see RTRV-<STM_TYPE>. • To retrieve all alarms on a specific OTN port, see RTRV-ALM-<MOD2ALM>. • To retrieve all conditions on a specific OTN port, see RTRV-COND-<MOD2ALM>. • To retrieve all alarms on a system, see RTRV-ALM-ALL. • To retrieve all conditions on a system, see RTRV-COND-ALL. • To retrieve all data, state, and shelf parameters on an associated equipment unit, see RTRV-EQPT. • To retrieve all general attributes on a system, see RTRV-NE-GEN. • To retrieve actual PM values on an OTN port, see RTRV-PM-<MOD2>. • To retrieve the thresholds in place for an OTN port, see RTRV-TH-<MOD2>. • To create a loopback, see OPR-LPBK-<MOD2>. • To release a loopback, see RLS-LPBK-<MOD2NCSPAYLOAD>.\\n\\n1.6.
