The team\\nfinished eighth and last in the National League with a record of 60â€“94, 30\\ngames behind the Chicago Cubs.  \\n## Offseason[edit]  \\nIn December, the Reds purchased outfielder Wally Roettger from the St. Louis\\nCardinals. Roettger, who began the 1931 season with the Reds before being\\ntraded to St. Louis, finished the season with a .321 batting average with a\\nhome run and 37 RBI in 89 games split between the two clubs. In three World\\nSeries games Roettger hit .286, helping the Cardinals win the 1931 World\\nSeries over the Philadelphia Athletics.  \\nOn December 2, Cincinnati acquired third baseman Andy High from the St. Louis\\nCardinals in exchange for outfielder Nick Cullop and cash. High had a .267\\naverage with 19 RBI in 63 games with St. Louis in 1931. His best seasons came\\nin 1924 when he played for the Brooklyn Robins, as High had a .328 batting\\naverage with six home runs and 61 RBI in 144 games, finishing in 12th place in\\nNational League MVP voting. In the 1931 World Series, High hit .267 in four\\ngames, helping the Cardinals to the championship.  \\nThe Reds sold infielder Hod Ford to the St. Louis Cardinals in late January.\\nFord had been with the Reds since 1926, and in 685 games with the club, he hit\\n.256 with five home runs and 215 RBI.  \\nOn February 4, Cincinnati purchased infielder George Grantham from the\\nPittsburgh Pirates. Grantham hit .305 with 10 home runs and 46 RBI in 127\\ngames with the Pirates in 1931. In 1930, Grantham hit .324 with 18 home runs\\nand 99 RBI. Grantham won the 1925 World Series with the Pirates, as they\\ndefeated the Washington Senators.  \\nOn March 14, the Reds and Brooklyn Dodgers made a big trade. Cincinnati traded\\naway second baseman Tony Cuccinello, third baseman Joe Stripp and catcher\\nClyde Sukeforth to Brooklyn in exchange for outfielder Babe Herman, third\\nbaseman Wally Gilbert and catcher Ernie Lombardi. Herman was coming off of a\\nseason in which he hit .313 with 18 home runs, 97 RBI and 17 stolen bases in\\n151 games. In 1930, Herman hit .393 with 35 home runs and 130 RBI, and stole\\n18 bases with the Dodgers. In 888 games with Brooklyn, Herman had a .339\\nbatting average with 112 home runs and 594 RBI. Gilbert had a .266 average\\nwith 46 RBI in 145 games during the 1931 season, while Lombardi hit .297 with\\nfour home runs and 23 RBI in 73 games.[1]  \\nThe Reds and St. Louis Cardinals made another deal in April, as Cincinnati\\ntraded pitcher Benny Frey, first baseman Harvey Hendrick and cash to St. Louis\\nin exchange for outfielder Chick Hafey. Hafey led the National League with a\\n.349 batting average in 1931, while hitting 16 home runs and earning 95 RBI in\\n122 games. Hafey won the World Series with the Cardinals in 1926 and 1931.  \\n## Regular season[edit]  \\nThe Reds had a solid start to the regular season, winning five of their first\\neight games, to sit in a tie with the Boston Braves for first place in the\\nNational League. The Reds then won only three of their next eight games to\\nfinish April in third place with a record of 8-8.  \\nThe Reds continued to play good baseball into May, and following a 4-3 win\\nover the Philadelphia Phillies on May 9, the Reds had a record of 14-11,\\nremaining in third place, 3.5 games behind the pennant leading Chicago Cubs.\\nOn this date, the Reds purchased pitcher Benny Frey from the St. Louis\\nCardinals. Frey, who pitched for the Reds from 1929-1931 before being\\npurchased by the Cardinals in the off-season, had a record of 0-2 with a 12.00\\nERA in two games with St. Louis in 1932.  \\nOn May 22, the Reds completed a three game series sweep against the first\\nplace Chicago Cubs, to improve their record to 21-17, cutting the Cubs lead to\\nonly three games over the third place Reds. Following the series, the Reds\\nslumped to a record of 4-17 in their next 21 games, as the team sank into last\\nplace.  \\nOn June 5, Cincinnati sold first baseman Mickey Heath to the St. Louis\\nCardinals, then purchased first baseman Harvey Hendrick from the Cardinals.\\nHendrick, who was the Reds starting first baseman in 1931, had a .250 average\\nwith a home run and five RBI in 28 games with St. Louis. On June 6, the Reds\\nreleased outfielder Harry Heilmann. Heilmann, who missed the entire 1931\\nseason due to arthritis of the wrist, struggled in 1932, hitting .258 with no\\nhome runs and six RBI in 15 games. This marked the end of Heilmann's career,\\nas in 2147 games, he hit .342 with 183 home runs and 1543 RBI, while stealing\\n111 bases. Heilmann spent the majority of his career with the Detroit Tigers.  \\nCincinnati would remain in last place for the rest of the season. The club\\nfinished the season with a record of 60-94, 30 games behind the pennant\\nwinning Chicago Cubs, and 12 games behind the St. Louis Cardinals and New York\\nGiants, who finished in a tie for sixth place. The 60 victories was the Reds\\nhighest total since winning 66 games in 1929, and was a two game improvement\\nover the 1931 club. Despite the last place finish, the Reds attendance rose by\\nnearly 100,000 fans over 1931, as Cincinnati drew 356,950, good for fifth in\\nthe National League.  \\nOutfielder Babe Herman had an excellent season with Cincinnati, as he led the\\nclub with a .326 batting average with 16 home runs and 87 RBI in 148 games.\\nCatcher Ernie Lombardi hit .303 with 11 home runs and 68 RBI in 118 games in\\nhis first season with the team. First baseman Harvey Hendrick hit .302 with\\nfour home runs and 40 RBI in 94 games after being acquired from the St. Louis\\nCardinals during the season.  \\nRed Lucas anchored the pitching staff, as in 31 starts, he had a record of\\n13-17 with a 2.94 ERA in 269.1 innings pitched. Lucas pitched an NL leading 28\\ncomplete games. Si Johnson finished the season with a 13-15 record with a 3.27\\nERA in 42 games. Johnson struck out a team high 94 batters.  \\n### Season standings[edit]  \\n* v\\n* t\\n* e  \\nNational League | W | L | Pct. | GB | Home | Road\\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---\\nChicago Cubs | 90 | 64  | 0.584  | â€”  | 53â€“24  | 37â€“40\\nPittsburgh Pirates | 86 | 68  | 0.558  | 4  | 45â€“31  | 41â€“37\\nBrooklyn Dodgers | 81 | 73  | 0.526  | 9  | 44â€“34  | 37â€“39\\nPhiladelphia Phillies | 78 | 76  | 0.506  | 12  | 45â€“32  | 33â€“44\\nBoston Braves | 77 | 77  | 0.500  | 13  | 44â€“33  | 33â€“44\\nSt. Louis Cardinals | 72 | 82  | 0.468  | 18  | 42â€“35  | 30â€“47\\nNew York Giants | 72 | 82  | 0.468  | 18  | 37â€“40  | 35â€“42\\nCincinnati Reds | 60 | 94  | 0.390  | 30  | 33â€“44  | 27â€“50  \\n### Record vs. opponents[edit]  \\n1932 National League record  \\n* v\\n* t\\n* e  \\nSources: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]\\n---\\nTeam  | BOS  | BR  | CHC  | CIN  | NYG  | PHI  | PIT  | STL\\nBoston | â€” | 15â€“7 | 8â€“14 | 9â€“13 | 11â€“11 | 11â€“11 | 10â€“12 | 13â€“9â€“1\\nBrooklyn | 7â€“15 | â€” | 10â€“12 | 15â€“7 | 15â€“7 | 8â€“14 | 12â€“10 | 14â€“8\\nChicago | 14â€“8 | 12â€“10 | â€” | 12â€“10 | 15â€“7 | 16â€“6 | 9â€“13 | 12â€“10\\nCincinnati | 13â€“9 | 7â€“15 | 10â€“12 | â€” | 7â€“15 | 9â€“13 | 8â€“14 | 6â€“16â€“1\\nNew York | 11â€“11 | 7â€“15 | 7â€“15 | 15â€“7 | â€” | 11â€“11 | 7â€“15 | 14â€“8\\nPhiladelphia | 11â€“11 | 14â€“8 | 6â€“16 | 13â€“9 | 11â€“11 | â€” | 14â€“8 | 9â€“13\\nPittsburgh | 12â€“10 | 10â€“12 | 13â€“9 | 14â€“8 | 15â€“7 | 8â€“14 | â€” | 14â€“8\\nSt. Louis | 9â€“13â€“1 | 8â€“14 | 10â€“12 | 16â€“6â€“1 | 8â€“14 | 13â€“9 | 8â€“14 | â€”  \\n### Roster[edit]  \\n1932 Cincinnati Reds\\n---\\n**Roster**\\n**Pitchers**  \\n* 19 Larry Benton\\n* 17 Ownie Carroll\\n* 16 Benny Frey\\n* 21 Whitey Hilcher\\n* 14 Si Johnson\\n* 15 Ray Kolp\\n* 12 Red Lucas\\n* 20 Jack Ogden\\n* 18 Eppa Rixey\\n* 30 Biff Wysong\", metadata={}),\n",
