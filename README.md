# Generative AI Chatbot Trained on Ciena and Blue Planet Documentation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our advanced chatbot project. This chatbot is powered by a generative AI model targeting the extensive corpus of Ciena and Blue Planet technical documentation. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and interactive method for users to retrieve relevant information from the vast knowledge of these documents.

## Introduction

With the amount of technical information increasing rapidly, it becomes a challenge to search for specific information manually. Our chatbot, designed with a state-of-the-art generative AI model, seeks to solve this problem, helping users retrieve the precise information they need, when they need it.

## Features

- Natural Language Understanding: Interprets user input and understands the context.
- Contextual Conversations: Can handle multiple rounds of conversation in context.
- Knowledge-Rich Responses: Leverages the extensive documentation of Ciena and Blue Planet for generating responses.
- Plug and play. Just drop the data and voila, we have a conversational agent that can answer your questions based on this data.
